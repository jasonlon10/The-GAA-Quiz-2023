<h2>Credits</h2>
For this project, I relied heavily on the walkthrough project and using Google to find relevant information and troubleshoot the code. I left myself with too little time to complete it due to external issues and this meant I had to settle for a basic enough design with basic functionality. The quiz questions and answers were pulled from my own knowledge of GAA. For the HTML, I actually used Project 1 as a reference for a lot of elements but I am comfortable with HTML so apart from using google to troubleshoot I was able to create this myself mainly, with support from some sections in the course and the previous project. 

For CSS, when googling for some issues I found reference to rem through this page on Hubspot and used this for the font size in the document - https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-rem The rest of the CSS is basic due to time constraints and I once again referenced project 1 for a lot of these elements. 

For Javascript, I struggled due to a lack of time to engage heavily in this module and relied upon the walkthrough project to guide most elements. I definitely need to go through this module in detail. When trying to adapt elements of the JS code to my own quiz, I struggled and often ended up having to start again as I did not know how I had caused some issues. I relied heavily on using google to find sources to troubleshoot. In the end, I had to make the JS code pretty basic because when i tried to evolve my idea, certain elements would not work. For example, I initially wanted to prompt users to select a sports section, whhich would then populate a question. Users would then submit their answer before automatically populating the next question. However, I was not able to get the question to appear so I had to abandon this idea. Hubspot was once again something i relied upon here. These sites were used for supporting and researching reasons and I do not recall simply taking one piece of code from any site for any elements of the project. 

The outline template for the HTML body was sourced from Code Institute
I referenced the slack forum through to find people who may have been having similar issues to me.
